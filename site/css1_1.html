<h2 id="1">SSC Ultimate</h2>  
<p class="hi">
The SSC Ultimate Aero is a mid-engined sports car that was produced by SSC North America (formerly known as Shelby SuperCars) from 2006 until 2013. The SSC Ultimate Aero held the title of the fastest production car in the world, according to the Guinness World Records, from 2007 (when it was officially timed at 256.14 mph (412.22 km/h)) until the introduction of the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport in 2010. However, in April 2013, the Guinness World Records temporarily disqualified the Veyron's record time for a period of five days, due to concerns about electronic speed limiting changing the function of the car, thereby reinstating the Ultimate Aero as the fastest production car in the interim.

  <h2 id = "3">Saleen S7</h2>
  <p class="hi">
  The Saleen S7 is an American hand-built, high-performance supercar designed and initially built in the UK by Automotive and Motorsport engineering company Ray Mallock Ltd.[5] on behalf of Saleen Inc. Developed jointly by Steve Saleen for the initial concept and direction, Hidden Creek Industries for resources and initial funding, Phil Frank for the body and interior CAD design and development,[6] it was the first fully proprietary car produced by Saleen and became America's first mid-engine production supercar. The S7 debuted on August 19, 2000 at the Monterey Historic Races. The all-aluminum engine is a bored-and-stroked derivative of Ford's 351 Windsor small block with Cleveland-style canted valve heads, not based on the FE big-block. It proved remarkably tractable and flexible for such a high-output unitâ€”550 hp at 6400 rpm.[7] In 2005, the S7 gained a more powerful twin-turbo powerplant which boosted engine power to 750 hp (559 kW) and top speed to 248 mph (399 km/h).[8]
